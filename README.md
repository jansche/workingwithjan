Stuff to know when working with me

A collection of things that might be useful when working with me.  

My philosophy: “Every day, I stand for equality and to shift the world towards being a better place for everyone.”  

 - I’m a remote worker. I usually go to the office only once or twice a week. When I do so, I want to connect with people I know and also those I haven’t met in-person yet. 

 - I generally work ~8:30am–~4.00pm CEST, and evening hours depending on load. I reserve quite some time for the family, also during the time that our timezones may overlap. I apologize (or do I?), that’s my priorities. 

  - Don’t feel obliged to give in to my schedule. Let’s try asynchronous syncing, if we can’t find face time. 

  - Answers to late-night emails isn’t expected or desired. I’m working when it fits my schedule. Feel free to answer when it fits your schedule. 

  - The persons I reserve time for: Wife: Claudia, daughter: Mia (born in 2007), son: Anton (born in 2013).  

  - If you receive an email from me at night then the right interpretation is “because Jan is doing work on their schedule” rather than “Jan wants an answer right now.” 

  - Same goes with Slack/Teams/WhatsApp or other chats. 

 - I recently started to set up meetings 5 minutes short of the hour / half the hour. This happens intentionally, to make room for short breaks. I learned this as a self-caring/family-caring practice during corona crisis, but it makes sense for me to continue to facilitate in that way. Expect me to also drop out of calls earlier in respect of up-following meetings.   

 - I don’t care if your email processing schedule aligns with mine or not (especially given the distributed nature of our global team.) 

 - If you want my urgent attention on something with tremendous importance, please try these things, in this order: Email me with hi-priority, DM me on Twitter (@jansche), give me a call and leave me a message on my mailbox (+4915158956104). 

 - My mobile is usually muted, i.e. fully silenced to not distract me from the thing I’m currently doing. Calling me without an appointed time usually doesn’t work. 

 - I’m disciplined in balancing work and life. There’s no clear borders between the two anymore, but still we need to assign ourselves to these segments of your day. 

 - I’m an advocate for inclusive behavior and Diversity & Inclusion in general. I might get back to you to talk with you on a behavior I saw that you showed or you were exposed to. Don’t be afraid of talking about that, I’m striving to make things better, not embarrass anyone. 

 - I rarely accept a meeting without an agenda unless it’s a 1:1 (possibly there’s a private reason I just don’t know about.) I recommend always having an agenda for meetings and if possible, pre-reads. This helps not only with attendance, but also makes the meeting time more productive.  

 - I encourage you to also find a mentor and sponsor (either internal or external) and for you to meet with other members of the team for your own learning and career growth. Feel free to meet with people I work with and ask for a recommendation.  

 - Information should be open. That applies to documents, sheets, slides, and often calendars (although I respect that you might not want your calendar to be visible to anyone). Decisions to disclose on information might vary though:  

  • good reason: protecting the confidence of a partner/customer/colleague 

  • good reason: the document includes personnel information 

  • poor reason: forgot to change the sharing settings 

  • poor reason: can’t imagine anybody else would be interested in this doc 

  • poor reason: the doc’s not finished yet 

 - Unless you aren’t feeling well or are traveling I encourage you to use video chat often. There’s so much body language involved in working together and this establishes a more “in person” connection with your vis-a-vis.  

 - Amongst other things I value honesty, kindness, straightforwardness, openness, agility and dependability. Call me out if I miss the mark on these!  

 - Ask me anything!  

 - I’m a kind supporter of awesomeness. You are 100% awesome. You might just need to be empowered. 

A lot of this is shamelessly ripped off from the document "Working With Kelly" by the wonderful Kelly McMichael ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/kellyshalk))
